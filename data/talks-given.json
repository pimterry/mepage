Open-source has never been the most accessible part of software development to jump into, but we can help fix that.</p><p>In this talk we’ll look at real-world examples of how DevOps tools and techniques have been used to simplify setup, development and deployment in a selection of open-source projects, and learn how you too can help make open-source more open, for everybody.</p>"

    "description": "<p>Securely setting up a web stack today is a tricky balancing act, as you gingerly balance frameworks and services and tools all atop one another, ever higher, to get all mod cons happily running together safely and correctly. One security flaw though, and the whole pile tumbles down on you to throw your customer passwords to the world.</p><p>In this talk we take a stroll down through a modern web stack and examine some recent major security breakages in each layer to see how they work and why. With any luck we can work out how to avoid this sort of thing in future too, when either using or building such tools, but if all else fails we can at least relax from all the careful balancing with a little schadenfreude.</p>"
